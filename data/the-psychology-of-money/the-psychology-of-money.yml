name: The Psychology of Money
description: A finance and behavior book by Morgan Housel that explores how
  emotions, biases, and attitudes shape financial decisions. While not
  startup-specific, it is widely recommended for founders because it builds a
  durable mindset around money, risk, and long-term thinking—crucial for
  navigating fundraising, personal wealth, and volatility in startups.
