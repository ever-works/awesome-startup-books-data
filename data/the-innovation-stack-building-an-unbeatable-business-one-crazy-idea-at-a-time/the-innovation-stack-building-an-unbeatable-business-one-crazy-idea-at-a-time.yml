name: "The Innovation Stack: Building an Unbeatable Business One Crazy Idea at a
  Time"
description: A startup and entrepreneurship book by Jim McKelvey, cofounder of
  Square, that explains how to build a resilient, category-defining company by
  assembling an “innovation stack” of interlocking, original solutions rather
  than copying existing models. It blends memoir and case studies to show
  founders how to compete with incumbents, embrace seemingly crazy ideas, and
  create defensible advantages in their own startups.
