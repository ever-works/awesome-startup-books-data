## Overview
Lean Media is a framework created by Ian Lamont that adapts lean and iterative development principles to media products such as books, films, and digital content. It is aimed at startup founders, creators, and media teams who want to rapidly test concepts with real audiences, refine their work based on feedback, and reduce risk in creative ventures and digital businesses.

## Features
- **Lean framework for media:** Applies concepts from the Lean Startup movement (iteration, testing, feedback loops) specifically to media production and digital content.
- **Audience-centric development:** Emphasizes understanding audiences early (“know your customer”) and using audience feedback to shape media products.
- **Iterative testing of concepts:** Encourages frequent, small tests of media ideas (e.g., pilots, prototypes, sample chapters, teaser content) rather than large, high-risk launches.
- **Risk reduction for creative ventures:** Provides a structured approach to minimize financial and creative risk in developing books, videos, podcasts, and other media.
- **Focus on online platforms and channels:** Oriented toward modern distribution via Amazon, Shopify, websites, social media, and other digital platforms.
- **Strategic and tactical guidance:** Helps teams design both high-level strategies and day‑to‑day tactics for growing media and e‑commerce ventures.
- **Cross-disciplinary applicability:** Useful for creators, startup founders, media companies, and brands operating in e‑commerce, publishing, and digital media.
- **Supports DTC (direct-to-consumer) models:** Addresses challenges of building and growing direct‑to‑consumer brands on marketplaces and independent sites.
- **Integration with digital marketing:** Connects media creation with digital advertising, conversion optimization, and platform‑specific best practices.
- **Educational resources:**
  - Book: "Lean Media" by Ian Lamont, detailing the framework and its application.
