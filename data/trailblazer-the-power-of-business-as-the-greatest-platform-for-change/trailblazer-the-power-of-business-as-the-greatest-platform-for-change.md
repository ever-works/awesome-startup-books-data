## Overview

“Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change” is a leadership and business book by Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and journalist Monica Langley. It examines how values-driven companies can operate as platforms for positive social change while still pursuing strong business performance and growth.

Although it is not a step-by-step startup manual, the book offers founders and leaders practical context on building mission-driven organizations, adopting stakeholder capitalism, and scaling a strong, values-based culture. It is particularly relevant for leaders who want to align profit with purpose and integrate social impact into their core business strategy.
