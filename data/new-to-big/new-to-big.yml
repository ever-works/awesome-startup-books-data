  # New to Big


  **Category:** Disruption & Innovation  

  **Brand:** Penguin Random House  

  **Website:** https://www.newtobig.com/


  ## Overview


  "New to Big" is a business book that teaches leaders in established
  organizations how to build a repeatable, startup-style innovation system. It
  explains how large, legacy companies can systematically discover, validate,
  and scale new growth opportunities by adopting the tools, mindsets, and
  investment approaches used by entrepreneurs and venture capitalists.


  ## Key Concepts


  - **New-to-big growth:** Focus on discovering and building new businesses from
  scratch inside established organizations, not just expanding existing ones.

  - **Growth Operating System (Growth OS):** A proposed, permanent capability
  inside a company that structures how new growth is found, funded, and scaled.

  - **Ladder vs. moonshot:** Emphasizes building an ongoing, systematic “ladder
  to the moon” (continuous innovation engine) rather than relying on one-off
  innovation “moonshots.”

  - **Borrowing from startups and VCs:** Adapts entrepreneurial and venture
  capital tools, systems, and mindsets for use in large, established companies.

  - **Offense-focused growth:** Positions legacy companies to proactively “go on
  offense” and compete for the future, rather than only optimizing current
  operations.


  ## Features


  - Explains the conflict between **operational efficiency/bureaucracy** and
  **new growth creation** in large organizations.

  - Provides a **blueprint** for installing a permanent growth capability (the
  Growth OS) inside established companies.

  - Describes **tools and systems** drawn from:
    - Early-stage entrepreneurship (e.g., experimentation, validation, lean approaches).
    - Venture capital (e.g., portfolio thinking, staged investment, evidence-based bets).
  - Focuses on creating **always-on growth**, not one-time innovation
  initiatives.

  - Oriented toward:
    - **Corporate leaders and executives** in large, legacy firms.
    - **Startup founders and operators** who want to understand how to scale and institutionalize innovation.
  - Connects organizational design (processes, governance, investment decisions)
  with the ability to repeatedly **discover and scale new business
  opportunities**.
