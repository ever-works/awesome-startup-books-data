  ## Description

  Startup CEO: A Field Guide to Scaling Up Your Business is a practical handbook
  for startup founders and CEOs who are navigating the transition from
  early-stage company to high-growth scaleup. Drawing on the author’s extensive
  experience founding and scaling startups, it focuses on the evolving role of
  the CEO and the concrete skills required to build an organization, manage a
  board, raise capital, and lead through rapid change.


  Written in an applied, checklist-driven style and based on years of lessons
  shared on StartupCEO.com, the book is designed as a reference guide that
  startup leaders can return to as they encounter specific growth and scaling
  challenges.


  ## Author Background (Context)

  - Written by Matt Blumberg, a repeat founder and CEO who has spent his career
  starting, scaling, and advising startups.

  - Based on operating experience including founding and scaling Return Path
  (email marketing company, 1999–2019) and co-founding Bolster (leadership and
  board development for startups and scaleups).

  - Extends themes from the StartupCEO.com blog and is part of a broader set of
  “field guide” books on startup leadership, company functions, and boards.


  ## Features

    - Practical advice on org structure, executive hiring, and managing executive performance.  
    - Checklists for assessing and benchmarking executive teams.

  - **Leadership & Management Practices**  
    - Tactics for leading through uncertainty, high growth, and change.  
    - Guidance on communication rhythms, meetings, and decision‑making discipline.  
    - Emphasis on operational discipline as a foundation for sustainable scaling.

  - **High-Growth Startup Focus**  
    - Tailored specifically to venture-backed or fast-growing startups and scaleups.  
    - Addresses common scaling pain points (people, process, governance, capital).

  - **Actionable Frameworks & Tools**  
    - Includes frameworks, checklists, and step‑by‑step guidance that can be applied directly by founders and CEOs.  
    - Designed as a “field guide” that can be consulted situationally rather than read only once.

  - **Ecosystem-Oriented Perspective**  
    - Reflects the perspective of an active founder/CEO embedded in the entrepreneurial ecosystem (with experience in leadership development platforms like Bolster and nonprofit talent initiatives like Path Forward).  
    - Oriented to the realities of working with executive teams, boards, and broader stakeholders in growth companies.

  ## Ideal Readers / Use Cases

  - First-time and repeat startup founders stepping into or currently in the CEO
  role.

  - Startup and scaleup CEOs seeking practical playbooks for organization
  building, fundraising, and board management.
