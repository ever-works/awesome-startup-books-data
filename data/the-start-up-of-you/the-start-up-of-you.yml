  ## Overview


  “The Start-up of You: Adapt, Take Risks, Grow Your Network, and Transform Your
  Career” reframes your career as if it were a startup business. Drawing on
  lessons from Silicon Valley and high-growth companies, the book explains how
  to navigate a competitive, uncertain economy by adopting entrepreneurial
  thinking—treating yourself as a “living, breathing, growing startup of you.”


  It is written for professionals across contexts: employees in large
  corporations, people assembling portfolio careers, and founders or aspiring
  entrepreneurs.
