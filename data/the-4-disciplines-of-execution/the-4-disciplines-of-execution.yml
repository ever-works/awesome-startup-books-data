  #### Overview

  “The 4 Disciplines of Execution” (4DX) is a framework for closing the gap
  between strategy and results. It helps teams and organizations turn high-level
  priorities into consistent, predictable execution by focusing on a small set
  of crucial goals and building supporting habits and systems.


  It is particularly useful for startups and fast-growing organizations that
  need to align people around what matters most and deliver reliably despite
  rapid change and competing demands.


  #### Features / Core Disciplines

  - **Discipline 1: Focus on the Wildly Important**  
    - Identify a small number of “wildly important goals” (WIGs) that matter most.  
    - Clarify specific target outcomes and timelines.  
    - Reduce distraction by subordinating less-critical work to these top priorities.

  - **Discipline 2: Act on the Lead Measures**  
    - Distinguish between lag measures (end results like revenue, user growth) and lead measures (controllable behaviors/activities that drive those results).  
    - Define and track lead measures that team members can directly influence day-to-day.  
    - Continuously adjust activities based on the performance of lead measures.

  - **Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard**  
    - Create simple, visible scoreboards that show the status of WIGs and lead measures at a glance.  
    - Ensure the scoreboard is designed for the team (easy to read, updated frequently).  
    - Use the scoreboard to reinforce focus and motivate consistent action.

  - **Discipline 4: Create a Cadence of Accountability**  
    - Establish a regular, short rhythm of team accountability meetings.  
    - In each meeting, review the scoreboard, report commitments, and make new commitments.  
    - Build a culture where individuals and teams own results and learn from week-to-week performance.

  #### Additional Concepts / Benefits

  - **Alignment around key goals:** Provides structure to align individuals,
  teams, and leaders on a small set of shared priorities.  

  - **Execution under pressure (“the whirlwind”):** Offers tools and routines
  for executing strategic work while managing everyday operational demands.  

  - **Scalability:** Can be applied at the individual, team, departmental, or
  organizational level.  

  - **Engagement:** Involves team members directly in setting lead measures and
  commitments, increasing ownership.  

  - **Predictable performance:** Aims to turn sporadic wins into a repeatable
  system of execution.


  #### Typical Use Cases

  - Startup and scale-up teams aligning on growth-critical goals.  

  - Leadership teams implementing new strategic priorities or transformations.  

  - Departments needing clearer focus and measurable progress on key
  initiatives.
