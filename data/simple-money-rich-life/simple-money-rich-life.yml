  ## Overview

  *Simple Money, Rich Life* is a personal finance and life-design book focused on helping readers intentionally manage money, reduce stress and burnout, and align their spending and earning with their core values. It is especially relevant for people with variable or risky income (such as founders or freelancers) who need a practical framework for financial stability while pursuing meaningful work.

  ## Features

  - **Values-based money management**  
    Emphasizes aligning your spending, saving, and giving with what genuinely matters to you, rather than chasing status or purely external goals.

  - **Designed for variable income and risk**  
    Offers principles and strategies that are useful for people with irregular income streams (e.g., entrepreneurs, startup founders, independent professionals) who must navigate uncertainty and financial risk.

  - **Burnout-aware approach**  
    Connects financial planning with lifestyle design, addressing how overwork and burnout can undermine both wealth-building and well-being.

  - **Life design focus**  
    Treats money as a tool to design a fulfilling life—incorporating work, rest, relationships, and purpose—rather than as an end in itself.

  - **Practical personal finance guidance**  
    Provides actionable advice on managing cash flow, setting priorities for spending, saving, and giving, and building habits that support long-term financial health.

  - **Mindset and behavior change**  
    Encourages shifts in financial mindset—around security, generosity, and success—supported by simple practices readers can implement over time.

  - **Suitable for a wide range of readers**  
    Although especially helpful for founders and others with fluctuating income, the concepts apply broadly to individuals and families seeking more intentional, less stressful money management.
