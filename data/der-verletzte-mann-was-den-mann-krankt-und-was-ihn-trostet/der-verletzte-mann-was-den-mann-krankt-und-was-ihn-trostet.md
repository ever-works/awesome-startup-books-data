# Der verletzte Mann: Was den Mann kränkt und was ihn tröstet

German‑language Kindle eBook that appears in the Peter Thiel Amazon Kindle Store listing. It is categorized under Business & Money / Education & Teaching, but it is not a recognized core startup or founder handbook like “Zero to One” and is more focused on male psychology and relationships than on building startups, so it is only tangentially relevant as a startup founder resource.
