name: "Der verletzte Mann: Was den Mann kränkt und was ihn tröstet"
description: German‑language Kindle eBook that appears in the Peter Thiel Amazon
  Kindle Store listing. It is categorized under Business & Money / Education &
  Teaching, but it is not a recognized core startup or founder handbook like
  “Zero to One” and is more focused on male psychology and relationships than on
  building startups, so it is only tangentially relevant as a startup founder
  resource.
