## Overview

*From Scratch: Libertarian Institutions and Communities* is a short Cato Unbound ebook that collects essays on how to build libertarian institutions and communities from the ground up. Rather than a traditional startup “how‑to” manual, it examines experimental governance and alternative institutional design—useful for readers interested in radical innovation and rethinking large‑scale systems.

## Features

- **Essay collection format**  
  A curated set of essays rather than a single‑author narrative, offering multiple perspectives on similar themes.

- **Focus on building from the ground up**  
  Explores how to design and launch new institutions and communities starting from first principles, instead of reforming existing ones.

- **Libertarian institutional design**  
  Centers on libertarian ideas about governance, property rights, voluntary association, and decentralized decision‑making.

- **Experimental governance**  
  Discusses how new governance models can be tested in practice, iterated, and scaled—relevant to anyone thinking about “beta‑testing” new social or political systems.

- **Alternative institutions**  
  Looks at substitutes or complements to traditional state‑driven structures, such as private or community‑based arrangements.

- **Bottom‑up system design**  
  Emphasizes bottom‑up, emergent approaches to building social and economic systems rather than top‑down planning.

- **Relevance to startup founders**  
  While not a startup playbook, the themes intersect with:
  - Radical innovation and long‑term societal change
  - Treating institutions themselves as startups or products
  - Designing new “markets” for governance and public goods

- **Connections to seasteading and frontier communities**  
  Speaks to audiences interested in:
  - Seasteading and new city projects
  - Charter cities or special jurisdictions
  - Other attempts to found new, semi‑autonomous communities.

- **Overlap with Peter Thiel’s intellectual milieu**  
  Aligns with ideas often associated with Peter Thiel and Founders Fund’s broader intellectual environment—such as skepticism of existing institutions, interest in frontier governance, and support for unorthodox experiments.

## Use Cases

- Founders and builders exploring new governance models for online or physical communities.
- Policy thinkers and academics studying libertarian approaches to institutional design.
- Innovators interested in seasteading, charter cities, or alternative jurisdictions.
- Readers seeking conceptual tools to rethink societal infrastructure as a design space.
