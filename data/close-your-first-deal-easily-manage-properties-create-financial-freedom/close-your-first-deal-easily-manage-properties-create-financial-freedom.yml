  property investing strategies, making it relevant to entrepreneurial readers.

  exploring small-business or real-estate-based startup models (e.g.,
  property-backed ventures, service businesses around rentals or management).

  - **Accessible to new investors:** Oriented toward people starting a business
  through property investing, with an emphasis on early steps rather than
  advanced finance.

  property-adjacent startup models.
