# This Could Be Our Future

A book by Kickstarter cofounder and former CEO Yancey Strickler that explores how businesses, technologists, and founders can move beyond a narrow focus on financial value toward more expansive, long-term forms of value. While not a tactical startup handbook, it’s a thought-provoking read for startup founders interested in building mission-driven companies and rethinking how technology and capital shape the future.
