name: This Could Be Our Future
description: A book by Kickstarter cofounder and former CEO Yancey Strickler
  that explores how businesses, technologists, and founders can move beyond a
  narrow focus on financial value toward more expansive, long-term forms of
  value. While not a tactical startup handbook, it’s a thought-provoking read
  for startup founders interested in building mission-driven companies and
  rethinking how technology and capital shape the future.
