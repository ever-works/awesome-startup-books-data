## Overview
“Brain Rules” is a popular science book by molecular biologist John Medina that explains 12 core principles about how the brain works. It focuses on practical implications for attention, memory, learning, sleep, stress, and performance. The website offers illustrated tutorials, charts, and videos that reinforce the key concepts in each chapter.

## Features

### Core Brain Rules Covered
1. **Exercise – Exercise boosts brain power**  
   - Explores how physical activity improves cognitive function and overall brain performance.

2. **Survival – The human brain evolved, too**  
   - Examines the evolutionary background of the human brain and how it shapes modern behavior and cognition.

3. **Wiring – Every brain is wired differently**  
   - Describes individual differences in brain wiring and their impact on learning and thinking styles.

4. **Attention – We don’t pay attention to boring things**  
   - Explains how attention works, what captures it, and why engaging content and environments matter.

5. **Memory (Short-Term) – Repeat to remember**  
   - Covers how short-term/working memory operates and the role of repetition in retaining information.

6. **Memory (Long-Term) – Remember to repeat**  
   - Focuses on how memories move into long-term storage and how spaced repetition helps consolidation.

7. **Sleep – Sleep well, think well**  
   - Details the relationship between sleep and cognitive performance, learning, and problem-solving.

8. **Stress – Stressed brains don’t learn the same way**  
   - Looks at how stress affects learning, memory, and decision-making.

9. **Sensory Integration – Stimulate more of the senses**  
   - Explains how multi-sensory experiences can improve understanding and recall.

10. **Vision – Vision trumps all other senses**  
    - Highlights the dominant role of vision in processing information and forming memories.

11. **Music – Study or listen to boost cognition**  
    - Discusses potential cognitive benefits of engaging with music while studying or working.

12. **Gender – Male and female brains are different**  
    - Describes observed differences between male and female brains and their implications.

13. **Exploration – We are powerful and natural explorers**  
    - Emphasizes curiosity-driven learning and the brain’s natural inclination to explore and experiment.

> Note: The site presents 12 primary “rules” as framed in the book; some sections (e.g., short-term vs. long-term memory) are separated for clarity, and exploration is also highlighted as a core theme.

### Learning Resources & Format
- **Illustrated tutorials** aligned with each rule.  
- **Charts and visuals** that summarize core concepts.  
- **Embedded videos** (hosted on Vimeo) corresponding to each rule (e.g., Exercise, Survival, Wiring, Attention, Memory, Sleep, Stress, Sensory Integration, Vision, Gender, Exploration).  
- **Music section** with dedicated content on music and cognition.

### Intended Use Cases
- Improving personal **work habits** and productivity.
- Enhancing **learning and memory** strategies.  
- Designing better **workplaces, teams, and environments** based on how the brain actually functions.  
- Supporting **founders, product leaders, and teams** who want evidence-informed approaches to performance and effectiveness.
