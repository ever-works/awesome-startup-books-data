Popular science book by molecular biologist John Medina that distills 12 research-backed principles about how the brain works. It focuses on attention, memory, sleep, stress, and other factors that influence learning, performance, and work habits—useful for founders, product leaders, and anyone designing better ways to learn and work.

## Features

### Core Principles ("Brain Rules")
Each rule is presented in the book and reinforced online through short illustrated tutorials, charts, and video explanations.

1. **Exercise – Exercise boosts brain power**  
   Explores how physical activity improves brain performance and supports learning and cognition.

2. **Survival – The human brain evolved, too**  
   Discusses how the brain’s evolution shapes how we think, respond, and learn today.

3. **Wiring – Every brain is wired differently**  
   Covers individual differences in brain wiring and implications for learning and work.

4. **Attention – We don't pay attention to boring things**  
   Explains how attention works, what captures it, and what causes us to lose it.

5. **Memory (Short-Term) – Repeat to remember**  
   Focuses on how short‑term/working memory functions and how repetition strengthens recall.

6. **Memory (Long-Term) – Remember to repeat**  
   Details strategies for consolidating information into long‑term memory through spaced repetition.

7. **Sleep – Sleep well, think well**  
   Connects sleep quality and patterns to cognitive performance, learning, and decision-making.

8. **Stress – Stressed brains don't learn the same way**  
   Describes how stress affects the brain, learning, and productivity.

9. **Sensory Integration – Stimulate more of the senses**  
   Shows how engaging multiple senses can improve understanding and memory.

10. **Vision – Vision trumps all other senses**  
    Explains the dominance of visual processing and how visuals support learning.

11. **Music – Study or listen to boost cognition**  
    Looks at how music relates to attention, learning, and cognitive performance.

12. **Gender – Male and female brains are different**  
    Reviews research on differences in male and female brains and their potential implications.

13. **Exploration – We are powerful and natural explorers**  
    Highlights curiosity, experimentation, and exploration as core to how the brain learns.

### Companion Learning Materials
- **Illustrated tutorials** for each rule (icons, diagrams, and visual explanations)
- **Short videos** (linked via Vimeo and site pages) that walk through key concepts of each rule
- **Chapter-linked structure**: tutorials are intended to be used after reading the corresponding book chapter to reinforce learning
