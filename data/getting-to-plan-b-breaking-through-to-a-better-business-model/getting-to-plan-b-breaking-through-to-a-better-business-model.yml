  # Getting to Plan B: Breaking Through to a Better Business Model


  **Category:** Startup methodologies  

  **Type:** Book


  ## Overview

  “Getting to Plan B” by John Mullins and Randy Komisar focuses on how founders
  can evolve an initial, assumption-heavy “Plan A” into a validated and
  sustainable “Plan B.” The book lays out a structured approach for testing core
  assumptions, learning from real-world data, and iterating toward a stronger
  business model. It complements lean and hypothesis-driven startup methods.


  ## Features

  - **Plan A to Plan B evolution** – Guides entrepreneurs in moving from their
  initial business idea to a refined, validated business model.

  - **Assumption testing** – Emphasizes identifying and rigorously testing the
  key “leaps of faith” in a business plan.

  - **Analogs and antilogs framework** – Uses examples of what has worked
  (analogs) and not worked (antilogs) in other businesses to inform and
  challenge your own model.

  - **Metrics-driven validation** – Encourages the use of clear, quantitative
  metrics to evaluate whether assumptions hold up in practice.

  - **Rapid iteration approach** – Promotes continuous learning and fast
  iteration rather than strict adherence to the original plan.

  - **Stress-testing business plans** – Provides a structured process to
  stress-test Plan A under real-world conditions.

  - **Focus on viability and endurance** – Helps founders adjust their model so
  the business can make money, solve real customer needs, and endure over time.

  - **Companion to lean startup practices** – Works well alongside lean and
  hypothesis-driven startup methodologies.
