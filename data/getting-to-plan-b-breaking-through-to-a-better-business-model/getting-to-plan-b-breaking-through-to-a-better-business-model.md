# Getting to Plan B: Breaking Through to a Better Business Model

**Category:** Startup methodologies  
**Type:** Book

## Overview
“Getting to Plan B” by John Mullins and Randy Komisar focuses on how founders can evolve an initial, assumption-heavy “Plan A” into a validated and sustainable “Plan B.” The book lays out a structured approach for testing core assumptions, learning from real-world data, and iterating toward a stronger business model. It complements lean and hypothesis-driven startup methods.

## Features
- **Plan A to Plan B evolution** – Guides entrepreneurs in moving from their initial business idea to a refined, validated business model.
- **Assumption testing** – Emphasizes identifying and rigorously testing the key “leaps of faith” in a business plan.
- **Analogs and antilogs framework** – Uses examples of what has worked (analogs) and not worked (antilogs) in other businesses to inform and challenge your own model.
- **Metrics-driven validation** – Encourages the use of clear, quantitative metrics to evaluate whether assumptions hold up in practice.
- **Rapid iteration approach** – Promotes continuous learning and fast iteration rather than strict adherence to the original plan.
- **Stress-testing business plans** – Provides a structured process to stress-test Plan A under real-world conditions.
- **Focus on viability and endurance** – Helps founders adjust their model so the business can make money, solve real customer needs, and endure over time.
- **Companion to lean startup practices** – Works well alongside lean and hypothesis-driven startup methodologies.
