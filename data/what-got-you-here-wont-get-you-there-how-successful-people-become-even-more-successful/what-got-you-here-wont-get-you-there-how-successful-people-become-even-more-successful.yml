  # What Got You Here Won't Get You There: How Successful People Become Even
  More Successful


  **Category:** Personal Development  

  **Tags:** leadership, habits, personal growth  

  **Author (book):** Marshall Goldsmith  

  **Publisher/Imprint:** Hyperion


  ## Overview


  “What Got You Here Won’t Get You There” explains why the strengths and beliefs
  that drove your past success can become obstacles at the next level—especially
  in leadership roles. Marshall Goldsmith focuses on behavioral and
  interpersonal habits that limit otherwise high-performing people, and offers a
  practical path to remove these roadblocks so they can lead larger teams and
  organizations more effectively.


  The book is particularly relevant for:

  - Senior leaders and executives

  - Startup founders moving from hands-on hustling to leading bigger teams

  - High achievers who want to continue growing beyond their current plateau


  ## Key Concepts


  ### The Paradox of Success


  Goldsmith identifies a “paradox of success”: the very beliefs that helped you
  excel can hold you back later. Successful people often share 4 core beliefs
  (as outlined in the book) that:

  - Reinforce confidence and drive

  - But also blind them to how their behavior affects others


  Once leaders rise in seniority, their weaknesses are usually **behavioral, not
  technical**. A few small but persistent interpersonal flaws can seriously
  damage relationships, team morale, and long-term impact.


  ### Behavioral vs. Technical Limits


  - Early career success often comes from technical competence and personal
  drive.

  - At higher levels, **how you behave**—how you listen, give credit, handle
  feedback, and relate to others—matters more than what you know.

  - Most successful leaders have **1–2 key bad habits** that do disproportionate
  damage.


  ## Features (Core Ideas & Tools from the Book)


  - **Identification of 20 Ineffective Leadership Habits**  
    The book catalogs 20 common unhelpful behaviors seen in senior leaders (e.g., needing to win too much, failing to give recognition, not listening, passing judgment, etc.). These are:
    - Typically subtle and often rationalized by the leader.
    - Highly visible and irritating to colleagues and subordinates.
    - Usually fixable by simply **stopping** the behavior once it’s recognized.

  - **Focus on Stopping, Not Adding**  
    Rather than piling on new tactics, Goldsmith emphasizes:
    - Identifying and **eliminating** destructive habits.
    - Understanding that subtraction (removing bad behaviors) often yields more benefit than adding new skills.

  - **Awareness as the First Lever of Change**  
    The book stresses:
    - Becoming acutely aware of how others experience you.
    - Acknowledging that your intent doesn’t erase the impact of your behaviors.

  - **Simple, Actionable Behavior Change**  
    Goldsmith’s approach is deliberately practical:
    - Target 1–2 high-impact habits instead of trying to overhaul your entire personality.
    - Use straightforward commitments and follow-through rather than complex systems.

  - **Application to Senior Leaders & Founders**  
    The material is tailored to people already performing at a high level who are:
    - Moving into broader, people-heavy roles.
    - Struggling with the shift from “individual star contributor” to “leader of others.”

  - **Career Risk of Ignored Habits**  
    The book highlights how repeating a small set of negative behaviors:
    - Erodes trust and goodwill.
    - Limits promotions, influence, and long-term success.
    - Has amplified impact as your responsibility and visibility grow.

  ## Use Cases


  - **Leadership development** for executives and high-potential managers.

  - **Founder coaching** for entrepreneurs scaling from small teams to larger
  organizations.

  - **Personal behavior audit** for professionals who are successful but sense
  they’ve plateaued.
