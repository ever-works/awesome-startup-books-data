name: Quantum Physics Made Me Do It
description: A popular-science book by Jeremie Harris that explores quantum
  mechanics, free will, and decision-making. While the author is a former AI
  startup founder, the book itself is not a startup or entrepreneurship text and
  does not focus on building or running startups, so it is not directly relevant
  as a core “must read” startup founder book.

  ### Overview
  “Quantum Physics Made Me Do It” is a popular-science exploration of how quantum mechanics relates to questions of free will, choice, and human decision-making. Written by Jeremie Harris, a former AI startup founder, the book focuses on physics and philosophy rather than entrepreneurship or startup building.

  ### Features
  - **Focus on Quantum Mechanics** – Introduces key ideas from quantum physics in an accessible, non-technical way for general readers.
  - **Free Will & Determinism** – Examines what quantum theory implies about whether our choices are truly free or predetermined.
  - **Decision-Making Lens** – Connects abstract physical theories to everyday human decisions and behavior.
  - **Popular-Science Style** – Written for non-specialists, aiming to explain complex concepts clearly without requiring advanced math or physics background.
  - **Interdisciplinary Approach** – Blends physics with philosophy of mind, ethics, and cognitive perspectives on choice.
  - **Author Background in AI & Startups** – Draws on the author’s experience in AI and tech, though the book itself is not a startup or business guide.
