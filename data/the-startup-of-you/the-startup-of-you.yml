name: The Startup of You
description: A revised and updated edition of Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha’s
  career strategy book that teaches professionals to think and act like startup
  founders—adapting quickly, taking intelligent risks, and building strong
  networks to create and seize opportunities. While framed around individual
  careers, it distills core startup principles (iterate fast, experiment, pivot,
  and leverage networks) that are highly relevant for startup founders and
  early-stage builders.
