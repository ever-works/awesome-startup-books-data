# The Startup of You

A revised and updated edition of Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha’s career strategy book that teaches professionals to think and act like startup founders—adapting quickly, taking intelligent risks, and building strong networks to create and seize opportunities. While framed around individual careers, it distills core startup principles (iterate fast, experiment, pivot, and leverage networks) that are highly relevant for startup founders and early-stage builders.
