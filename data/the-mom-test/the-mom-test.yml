  ## Features


  - **Practical guide to customer conversations**  
    - Shows how to learn whether a business idea is good *without* relying on polite or biased feedback.  
    - Focuses on collecting reliable, decision-ready information from real users.

  - **Core concept: “The Mom Test”**  
    - A set of rules for asking questions that even your own mother can’t easily lie about to protect your feelings.  
    - Emphasizes that people (especially friends and family) are naturally polite and will often say what you want to hear rather than the truth.

  - **Principles for unbiased customer interviews**  
    - Stop pitching your idea during conversations; instead, focus on the customer’s life, context, and existing behavior.  
    - Replace opinion-based questions with behavior-based questions about what customers actually did in the past.  
    - Prioritize listening over talking so you learn more and avoid leading the interviewee.

  - **Three core rules of The Mom Test**  
    1. **Talk about their life, not your idea** – uncover real problems and workflows instead of seeking validation for your solution.  
    2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generalities or future hypotheticals** – people are bad at predicting what they will do, but can accurately describe what they have done.  
    3. **Talk less, listen more** – minimize your own talking so you don’t bias answers or steer the conversation.

  - **Guidance on good vs. bad questions**  
    - **Avoid** questions like:  
      - “Do you think this is a good idea?”  
      - “Would you buy a product that did X?”  
      - “How much would you pay for X?”  
    - **Use** questions that:  
      - Probe past behavior: what they currently do, which tools they use, how often they encounter the problem, and why they chose their current workaround.  
      - Explore specific problems: e.g., identifying concrete people or scenarios where the problem appears.

  - **Focus on real problems and real people**  
    - Encourages founders to identify and articulate specific user problems instead of chasing abstract “good ideas.”  
    - Suggests tests like: “Can you name three specific people with this problem?” to check that you’re dealing with a real, observable need.

  - **Applies to early-stage idea validation and customer discovery**  
    - Designed for founders exploring new ideas, features, or products.  
    - Helps avoid false positives that come from enthusiastic but non-committal feedback.

  - **Applicable beyond “burning problems”**  
    - Can be used on a wide range of ideas, including those that are novel, fun, or not obviously solving a painful problem, by grounding conversations in real behavior and context rather than speculative enthusiasm.

  - **Format and access**  
    - Available as a book; further information and resources at the official site: <http://momtestbook.com/>
