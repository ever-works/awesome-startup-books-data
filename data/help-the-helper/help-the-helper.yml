  - **Relevance for Startups:** Tailored insights for startup founders and early-stage leaders who are:
    - Building initial teams from the ground up.
    - Establishing cultural norms and leadership expectations.
    - Seeking to avoid dysfunction as they scale.
  - **High-Performance Practices:** Distills principles and behaviors that underpin high-performing teams (e.g., role clarity, humility, and service-minded leadership).
