## Overview
“Diffusion of Innovations” by Everett M. Rogers is a foundational work explaining how new ideas, products, and technologies spread through populations over time. It introduces the Technology Adoption Life Cycle and is widely used by startup founders, investors, and innovators to understand adoption curves, early adopters, and how innovations move from niche communities into the mainstream.

## Features
- **Technology Adoption Life Cycle Framework**  
  - Explains how innovations move from introduction to mainstream adoption and eventual saturation.  
  - Describes the dynamics between early markets and mainstream markets.

- **Five Adopter Categories**  
  - **Innovators** – First to adopt new ideas or technologies; comfortable with risk and experimentation.  
  - **Early Adopters** – Opinion leaders who adopt early and help validate innovations for a broader audience.  
  - **Early Majority** – More pragmatic users who adopt once value and reliability are clearer.  
  - **Late Majority** – Skeptical and risk-averse; adopt when something is already mainstream.  
  - **Laggards** – Last to adopt; tend to rely on tradition and established solutions.

- **Information Sources by Adopter Group (Modern Internet Context)**  
  Interpreting Rogers’ adopter types in terms of where each group discovers and shares innovations online:
  - **Innovators**  
    - Code repositories and issue trackers (e.g., GitHub, OSS issue trackers)  
    - Preprints of research papers  
    - Personal blogs  
    - Email lists and niche forums  
    - Discord communities  
    - Discussion-focused subreddits on Reddit
  - **Early Adopters**  
    - Academic journals  
    - Industry blogs  
    - Niche Twitter and niche Reddit communities  
    - Patent applications (often lagging actual innovation in software)  
    - Industry news sources (e.g., tech-focused outlets, independent newsletter writers)  
    - Industry meetups  
    - Podcasts
  - **Early Majority**  
    - Venture capital market maps  
    - Industry conferences  
    - Analyst reports (e.g., Gartner, McKinsey)  
    - Webinars
  - **Late Majority**  
    - Mainstream news outlets  
    - App store rankings  
    - Trending lists and sections  
    - Television
  - **Laggards**  
    - Educational curriculum (college or high school)  
    - Books  
    - Wikipedia  
    - Documentaries and movies

- **Application to Startups and Innovation Strategy**  
  - Helps founders identify where to look for and engage initial users (e.g., niche forums, Discord, specialized communities).  
  - Informs go-to-market strategies by mapping communication channels to adopter segments.  
  - Highlights that widely visible channels (e.g., news aggregators, mainstream media) typically cannot be the *first* source for truly new innovations.

## Use Cases
- Startup founders designing early user acquisition and go-to-market strategies.  
- Product teams planning how to cross from niche adoption to mainstream markets.  
- Investors tracking where cutting-edge ideas and companies first appear.  
- Researchers and students studying innovation diffusion, consumer behavior, and market dynamics.
