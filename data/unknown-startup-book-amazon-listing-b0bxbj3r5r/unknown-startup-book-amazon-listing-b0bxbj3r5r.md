### Features

Since the Amazon product page content is not visible, features below are inferred from the related article and may only partially describe the ASIN B0BXBJ3R5R listing:

- **Focus on non-tech founders**  
  Designed for founders without a software/engineering background who are building tech-enabled products or platforms.

- **Emphasis on digital asset ownership**  
  Explains how founders can avoid losing control of core assets such as source code, domains, infrastructure accounts, hosting, and critical product IP when working with external developers or agencies.

- **Strategic, non-technical frameworks**  
  Presents founder-first frameworks that emphasize decision-making, contracts, and operational safeguards rather than deep technical implementation details.

- **Grounded in real-world experience**  
  Developed from over a decade of work with non-technical founders across Africa and other emerging markets, where issues of asset control, vendor lock-in, and misaligned expectations are common.

- **Risk awareness and mitigation**  
  Highlights typical scenarios where founders unknowingly forfeit control (e.g., developers owning repositories and cloud accounts, ambiguous contracts, lack of documentation) and offers practical steps to prevent them.

- **Guidance on working with tech partners**  
  Provides advice on how to structure relationships with developers, product studios, or agencies so that founders maintain decision-making power and ownership while still benefiting from external expertise.

- **Context for emerging markets**  
  Draws examples from African and other emerging ecosystems, where legal protections and standard practices around IP and digital ownership may be less mature or less clearly understood by first-time founders.

- **Foreword and expert review (book-level, not ASIN-confirmed)**  
  The related article notes a foreword by **Babatunde Akin-Moses (Sycamore)** and expert review by **Dr. Ebi Ofery (GeroCare)**, both non-tech founders of tech-enabled businesses. This underscores the book’s relevance to founders who operate in similar contexts, though these details are not directly verifiable against the ASIN page from the snippet.
