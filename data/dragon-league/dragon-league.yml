name: Dragon League
description: '"Dragon League" (ISBN 1957463880) appears in the captured Amazon
  URL but, based on the fragment available, it is likely a fictional or
  entertainment title rather than a non-fiction startup or entrepreneurship
  book. There is no clear indication that it is a must-read resource for startup
  founders, so it does not match the directory’s focus on ‘Awesome Startup
  Books’. It should be excluded from the directory as irrelevant to startup
  founders’ needs.'
