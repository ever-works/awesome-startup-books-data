# Dragon League

"Dragon League" (ISBN 1957463880) appears in the captured Amazon URL but, based on the fragment available, it is likely a fictional or entertainment title rather than a non-fiction startup or entrepreneurship book. There is no clear indication that it is a must-read resource for startup founders, so it does not match the directory’s focus on ‘Awesome Startup Books’. It should be excluded from the directory as irrelevant to startup founders’ needs.
