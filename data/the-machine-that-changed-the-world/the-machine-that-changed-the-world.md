#The Machine That Changed the World

Seminal 1990 book by James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, and Daniel Roos that popularized the term “lean” for streamlined production systems, based on an in-depth study of the Toyota Production System and global auto manufacturing. While not a startup book per se, it is a key precursor to lean thinking and later lean startup ideas, offering deep insight into waste reduction, continuous improvement, and customer value—concepts that can inform how startup founders design efficient operations and product development processes.
