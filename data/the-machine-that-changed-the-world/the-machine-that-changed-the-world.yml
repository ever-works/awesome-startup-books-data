name: The Machine That Changed the World
description: Seminal 1990 book by James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, and Daniel
  Roos that popularized the term “lean” for streamlined production systems,
  based on an in-depth study of the Toyota Production System and global auto
  manufacturing. While not a startup book per se, it is a key precursor to lean
  thinking and later lean startup ideas, offering deep insight into waste
  reduction, continuous improvement, and customer value—concepts that can inform
  how startup founders design efficient operations and product development
  processes.
