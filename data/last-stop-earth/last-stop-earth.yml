name: Last Stop Earth
description: Last Stop Earth appears to be a fiction title (likely science
  fiction) sold via Amazon and is not a startup or business book. It does not
  provide guidance or frameworks for startup founders, nor is it recognized as a
  must-read book for startups. As such, it is not directly relevant to a
  directory of “Awesome Startup Books” and should be excluded from that list.
