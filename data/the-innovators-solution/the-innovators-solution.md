## Overview

*The Innovator’s Solution* is Clayton Christensen’s follow‑up to *The Innovator’s Dilemma*. It focuses on how companies can deliberately create and sustain successful growth through disruptive innovation, rather than treating disruption as a random or purely defensive challenge.

The book is especially relevant for startup founders and innovators who want a systematic way to spot disruptive opportunities and build businesses around them.

## Key Topics

- How disruptive innovation differs from sustaining innovation
- Patterns that explain which innovations will drive long‑term growth
- How to identify markets that are vulnerable to disruption
- Frameworks for designing disruptive business models
- Strategic choices that help incumbents and startups build disruptive growth engines

## Features

- **Disruption theory applied to growth:** Extends the original “disruptive innovation” theory into a practical playbook for achieving new growth.
- **Opportunity identification:** Provides criteria and lenses to recognize where disruptive plays are likely to succeed.
- **Market-creation focus:** Emphasizes creating new markets and jobs-to-be-done rather than just competing for existing customers.
- **Business model design:** Discusses how value propositions, profit formulas, and capabilities must align to support disruptive growth.
- **Incumbent vs. startup strategies:** Explores how established firms and new entrants can each approach disruption differently.
- **Practical guidance for founders:** Helps startup founders think beyond product features to scalable, defensible disruptive businesses.
