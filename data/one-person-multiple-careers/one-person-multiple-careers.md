## Overview
“One Person, Multiple Careers” examines how professionals can intentionally design and manage a work life built around multiple careers or “slashes” (e.g., lawyer/consultant/writer). It is especially relevant for people who combine traditional employment, side projects, consulting, and entrepreneurial ventures—such as startup founders who are juggling several roles at once.

## Features
- **Focus on “slash” careers**: Explores the concept of holding multiple distinct professional identities at the same time (e.g., teacher/coach/artist), rather than following a single linear career path.
- **Frameworks for multi-career design**: Provides structures and mental models for planning and integrating several careers in parallel, including how to decide what to combine and how to prioritize.
- **Case studies and real-world examples**: Shares stories of individuals successfully managing multiple careers, illustrating different ways to structure a multi-track work life.
- **Relevance for founders and entrepreneurs**: Addresses challenges common to startup founders—such as balancing a day job with a new venture, consulting alongside building a product, or managing multiple roles within an early-stage company.
- **Guidance on identity and positioning**: Discusses how to present and explain multiple professional identities to employers, clients, collaborators, and networks.
- **Strategies for opportunity-building**: Emphasizes creating a flexible, opportunity-rich career setup that can adapt as interests and markets change.
- **Support for side projects and transitions**: Useful for people testing new fields, transitioning careers gradually, or keeping multiple income streams active.
