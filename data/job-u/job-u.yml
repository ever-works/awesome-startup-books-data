  ## Description


  *Job U* examines how careers are evolving in the modern economy and what
  individuals can do to stay employable, adaptable, and skilled. It emphasizes
  practical approaches to career building—such as identifying in-demand skills,
  understanding new educational and training pathways, and adapting to shifts in
  the job market.


  For startup founders, the book is secondarily valuable as a lens on how talent
  is being trained and how workers think about their own careers, which can
  inform hiring, team development, and long-term workforce planning.
