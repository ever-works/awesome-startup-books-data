name: Taking a Mexican Company Global—The CEMEX Way
description: A Harvard Business School case study about CEMEX’s global
  growth-through-acquisition strategy. While focused on corporate expansion,
  finance, and operations, it is a teaching case rather than a must‑read book
  for startup founders and does not belong in a core startup books directory.
