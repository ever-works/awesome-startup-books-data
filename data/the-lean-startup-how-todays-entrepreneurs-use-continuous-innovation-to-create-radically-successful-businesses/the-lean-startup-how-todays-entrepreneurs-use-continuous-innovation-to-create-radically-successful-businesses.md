## Overview
“The Lean Startup” presents a systematic, scientific approach to building new products and companies under conditions of extreme uncertainty. It adapts principles from lean manufacturing to help entrepreneurs test ideas quickly, learn what customers actually want, and build sustainable businesses with less waste.

## Key Concepts
- **Startup definition:** Any organization (from solo founder to large enterprise team) dedicated to creating something new under conditions of extreme uncertainty.
- **Validated learning:** Using real customer data and experiments to confirm or disprove assumptions, rather than relying on opinions or vanity metrics.
- **Build–Measure–Learn loop:** A rapid cycle of building a product (or feature), measuring customer response, and learning whether to persevere or change direction.
- **Minimum Viable Product (MVP):** The simplest version of a product that allows fast learning about customers with minimal time and resources.
- **Pivot and agility:** Structured ways to change direction based on evidence, allowing plans to be adjusted incrementally and quickly.
