  ## Description
  “The Innovation Stack” explores how groundbreaking companies build unique “innovation stacks” — layers of interlocking inventions and decisions — to outmaneuver competitors and create defensible, category-defining businesses.

    Analyzes how companies can respond when powerful competitors try to replicate their products or undercut them.

  - **Category-Creating Strategies**  
    Discusses how new markets and categories are created by stacking novel approaches in product, pricing, distribution, customer experience, and more.
