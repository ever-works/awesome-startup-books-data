## Overview

Spanish edition of the influential business strategy book *Blue Ocean Strategy*. It presents a systematic framework for entrepreneurs and founders to move away from saturated, highly competitive markets (“red oceans”) and instead create uncontested market spaces (“blue oceans”) through value innovation. The book is aimed at readers who want to differentiate their products, craft innovative value propositions, and design defensible business models by focusing on delivering new value rather than beating competitors.
