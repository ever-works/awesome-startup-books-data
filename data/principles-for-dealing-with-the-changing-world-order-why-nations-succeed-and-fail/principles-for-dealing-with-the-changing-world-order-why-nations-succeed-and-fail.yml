name: "Principles for Dealing with the Changing World Order: Why Nations Succeed
  and Fail"
description: A macroeconomic and geopolitical analysis by Ray Dalio that
  explains how and why empires rise and fall, using historical cycles to
  understand current global shifts. While not a startup how‑to book, it’s
  valuable for founders and investors who need to think in long time horizons
  about economic cycles, debt, inflation, reserve currencies, and changing
  global power structures that can impact markets, fundraising climates, and
  long‑term strategy.
