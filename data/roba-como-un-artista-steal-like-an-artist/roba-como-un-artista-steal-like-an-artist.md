### Features

- **10 core principles for creativity** (originating from Kleon’s 2011 talk and expanded into a full book):
  1. *Steal like an artist* – treat creativity as remix; learn to consciously draw from and transform your influences rather than pursuing impossible originality.
  2. *Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started* – begin making work before you feel fully “ready” or fully defined as a creator.
  3. *Write the book you want to read* – create the product, project, or art you personally wish existed.
  4. *Use your hands* – integrate analog, hands‑on processes (drawing, cutting, writing by hand) to stimulate thinking and avoid being purely digital.
  5. *Side projects and hobbies are important* – maintain parallel interests and experiments that feed your main work and keep creativity fresh.
  6. *The secret: do good work and share it with people* – prioritize quality and generous sharing to attract opportunities and collaborators.
  7. *Geography is no longer our master* – leverage the internet and digital networks to connect, learn, and publish from anywhere.
  8. *Be nice (the world is a small town)* – cultivate a supportive network, good reputation, and collaborative mindset.
  9. *Be boring (it’s the only way to get work done)* – rely on routine, stability, and disciplined habits to consistently create.
  10. *Creativity is subtraction* – use constraints and deliberate limits to focus your work and enhance originality.
