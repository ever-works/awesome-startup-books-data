## Overview

“Roba como un artista / Steal Like an Artist” is the Spanish edition of Austin Kleon’s concise guide to creativity. It presents 10 practical principles for developing creative work by learning from others, remixing influences, and building sustainable creative habits. It is particularly useful for founders, creators, and knowledge workers who need to generate and refine ideas consistently.

## Features

- **10 core principles for creativity** (origin of the book was a talk built around these):
  1. Steal like an artist – learn to consciously draw from and remix influences rather than chase pure originality.
  2. Don’t wait until you know who you are to get started – begin creating before you feel fully “ready.”
  3. Write the book you want to read – make the work you wish existed.
  4. Use your hands – incorporate analog / physical making alongside digital tools.
  5. Side projects and hobbies are important – treat them as legitimate sources of ideas and energy.
  6. The secret: do good work and share it with people – focus on craft and visibility.
  7. Geography is no longer our master – use the internet to find your people and opportunities.
  8. Be nice. (The world is a small town.) – build a creative life on generosity and good relationships.
  9. Be boring. (It’s the only way to get work done.) – rely on routines and stability to support output.
  10. Creativity is subtraction – embrace constraints and editing to make work stronger.
