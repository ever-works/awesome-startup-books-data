  A practical book by Teresa Torres for product leaders and startup founders on
  how to build a culture of continuous learning and experimentation so products
  keep evolving with customer needs.


  ## Overview


  *Continuous Discovery Habits* explains how to embed ongoing customer learning
  into everyday product work. It focuses on developing habits such as regular
  customer conversations, testing assumptions early, and running rapid
  experiments to reduce product risk and consistently ship features that create
  real customer and business value.


  ## Features

  - **Integrating discovery into workflow**  
    - Making customer learning a regular part of the product team’s weekly routine.  
    - Working discovery alongside delivery so teams continuously learn while shipping.
