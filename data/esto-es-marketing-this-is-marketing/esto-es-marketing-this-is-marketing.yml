  ## Features

  - **Core marketing philosophy in one volume**  
    Brings together the main principles from Seth Godin’s prior work (e.g., *Permission Marketing*, *Purple Cow*, *Tribes*, *The Dip*) into a single, compact framework.

  - **Focus on meaningful work**  
    Guides readers to do marketing they can be proud of, whether they operate a tech startup, a small local business, or work inside a large corporation.

  - **Empathy-driven approach**  
    Emphasizes understanding the people you serve, seeing the world through their eyes, and using that understanding to shape both product and message.

  - **Problem-solving orientation**  
    Frames marketing as the act of solving other people’s problems rather than pushing products to meet a company’s internal goals.

  - **Connection and trust**  
    Highlights the importance of building relationships, trust, and human connection instead of relying on interruption or manipulation.

  - **Emotional labor**  
    Discusses the “emotional labor” of showing up for your audience, listening carefully, and taking responsibility for the change you seek to make.

  - **Positioning and differentiation**  
    Helps readers think clearly about where their product or service fits in the market, who it is for, and how it stands out in a crowded field.

  - **Audience definition and focus**  
    Encourages choosing a specific group of people to serve deeply instead of trying to appeal to everyone.

  - **Relevance for product–market fit**  
    Useful for early-stage founders who need to align what they are building with what a clearly defined audience actually wants and needs.

  - **Brand narrative and storytelling**  
    Shows how to craft stories about your product or service that resonate with your audience’s worldview and aspirations.

  - **Spanish-language accessibility**  
    Makes Godin’s marketing concepts available to Spanish-speaking readers, professionals, and students.

  - **Business & Economics focus**
