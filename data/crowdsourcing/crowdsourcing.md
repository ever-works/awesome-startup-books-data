## Overview

“Crowdsourcing” by Jeff Howe explores how the power of large online communities can be organized and leveraged for innovation, problem‑solving, and content creation. It is particularly relevant for startup founders and product builders interested in marketplace, platform, and community‑driven business models.

The book examines how the internet enables organizations to tap into distributed talent and collective intelligence, and how this reshapes traditional approaches to work, creativity, and R&D.
