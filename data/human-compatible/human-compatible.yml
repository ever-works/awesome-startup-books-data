  ## Overview

  Human Compatible is a book by Stuart Russell that examines the long‑term
  implications of advanced artificial intelligence and the challenges of keeping
  powerful AI systems under meaningful human control. It offers conceptual and

  ## Features

  - **Focus on AI safety and control:** Explores how increasingly capable AI
  systems might behave in complex real‑world environments and what can go wrong
  if their objectives are poorly specified.

  - **Long‑term implications of advanced AI:** Discusses potential futures
  involving highly capable or general AI systems and their impact on
  civilization.

  - **Value alignment frameworks:** Presents ideas and approaches for designing
  AI systems that pursue goals compatible with human preferences and values.

  - **Risk analysis:** Examines risks posed by misaligned or inadequately
  controlled AI, including large‑scale societal and economic consequences.

  - **Ethical and societal perspective:** Considers broader questions of
  responsibility, governance, and the role of AI in society.

  - **Strategic context for practitioners and founders:** Provides a high‑level
  framing that helps AI builders think about safety, robustness, and long‑term
  impact when designing products and organizations.

  - **Conceptual rather than technical treatment:** Oriented toward readers who
  want to understand big‑picture challenges around AI, rather than detailed
  algorithms or implementation guides.
