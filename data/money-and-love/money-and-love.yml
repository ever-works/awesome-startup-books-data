name: Money and Love
description: Money and Love is a practical decision-making book by labor
  economist Myra Strober and social innovation leader Abby Davisson that
  presents a 5Cs framework to navigate major life choices—such as career moves,
  family planning, financial decisions, and relationships—by jointly considering
  money and love. While not a pure startup manual, its structured approach to
  high-stakes decisions, work-life balance, and financial tradeoffs is relevant
  for startup founders making consequential personal and professional choices.
