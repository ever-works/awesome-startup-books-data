# Money and Love

Money and Love is a practical decision-making book by labor economist Myra Strober and social innovation leader Abby Davisson that presents a 5Cs framework to navigate major life choices—such as career moves, family planning, financial decisions, and relationships—by jointly considering money and love. While not a pure startup manual, its structured approach to high-stakes decisions, work-life balance, and financial tradeoffs is relevant for startup founders making consequential personal and professional choices.
