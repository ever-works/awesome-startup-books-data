name: Your Face Belongs to Us
description: Investigative non-fiction book about a secretive AI-powered facial
  recognition startup and its implications for privacy and surveillance. While
  centered on a startup, it is primarily a tech-journalism and ethics book
  rather than a how-to or must-read guide for startup founders, so its relevance
  to a "must read startup books" directory is peripheral.

  ## Overview


  *Your Face Belongs to Us* is an investigative non-fiction work that examines a
  secretive, AI-powered facial recognition startup and its far‑reaching
  implications for privacy, surveillance, and civil liberties. Rather than a
  startup or business how‑to guide, it is a piece of tech journalism focused on
  ethics, power, and the social consequences of emerging technologies.


  ## Features


  - **Investigative Tech Journalism**  
    Explores how a little‑known facial recognition startup built and deployed its technology, including the people, decisions, and systems behind it.

  - **Focus on AI and Facial Recognition**  
    Centers on AI‑driven facial recognition: how it works in practice, where it is used, and what makes it uniquely powerful and intrusive.

  - **Privacy and Surveillance Themes**  
    Examines the erosion of personal privacy in a world where faces can be identified and tracked at scale, and the broader shift toward pervasive surveillance.

  - **Ethical and Legal Questions**  
    Raises issues around consent, data use, government and law‑enforcement access, and the adequacy (or lack) of current regulations.

  - **Case Study of a Startup**  
    Uses a secretive startup as the narrative lens—covering its founding, rapid expansion, and controversies—while remaining focused on societal impact rather than offering startup advice.

  - **Relevance to Technology, Law, and Policy**  
    Useful context for readers interested in technology ethics, civil liberties, digital rights, and the policy debates surrounding AI.

  - **Journalistic Narrative Style**  
    Written as a reported narrative, blending storytelling with documented research rather than as a technical manual or business playbook.

  ## Ideal Readers


  - Readers interested in surveillance, privacy, and digital rights

  - Those following the social and ethical impacts of AI

  - Nonfiction readers who enjoy investigative reporting about technology and
  power
