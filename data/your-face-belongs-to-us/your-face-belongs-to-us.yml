name: Your Face Belongs to Us
description: Investigative non-fiction book about a secretive AI-powered facial
  recognition startup and its implications for privacy and surveillance. While
  centered on a startup, it is primarily a tech-journalism and ethics book
  rather than a how-to or must-read guide for startup founders, so its relevance
  to a "must read startup books" directory is peripheral.

    "Your Face Belongs to Us" is an investigative non-fiction book by journalist Kashmir Hill that explores a secretive AI-powered facial recognition startup and the broader implications of this technology for privacy, surveillance, and civil liberties.

    - Reporting on the tension between technological innovation, public safety claims, and civil liberties.
    - Contextualization of facial recognition within broader debates on data rights and digital consent.
    - Narrative-driven tech journalism, blending character-focused storytelling with policy and legal issues.
