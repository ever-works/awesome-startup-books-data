name: Stories for Boys
description: A motivational story collection aimed at young boys, focused on
  themes of confidence, courage, and kindness. While inspirational in nature, it
  is not specifically about startups, entrepreneurship, or founding companies,
  and therefore falls outside the scope of a directory of must‑read books for
  startup founders.
