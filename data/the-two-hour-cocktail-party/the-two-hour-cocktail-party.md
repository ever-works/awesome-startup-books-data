“The Two Hour Cocktail Party” is a practical, step‑by‑step book by Nick Gray that teaches professionals how to host small, structured, two‑hour gatherings to build and deepen professional and personal relationships. It is especially useful for founders and professionals who want to efficiently grow networks of advisors, early customers, and supporters.

## Key Purpose
- Help adults make new friends and connections, especially in their local area or neighborhood.
- Provide a repeatable formula for hosting small events that feel fun but are intentionally structured.

## Features

### Hosting Framework

  - Events are strictly limited to two hours.
  - Emphasizes a clear start and end time to keep energy high and make hosting manageable.

- **Ideal days and timing**
  - Recommends hosting on non–“red-level” days (typically Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday evenings).
  - Avoids busier social days so guests have fewer conflicts and are more likely to attend.

- **RSVP and invitations**
  - Encourages collecting RSVPs for better commitment and headcount.
  - Promotes **1:1 personal invitations** instead of mass emails or broad social posts.

  - Refers to a dedicated icebreaker guide with additional prompts and ideas.

- **Group photo**
  - Advises taking a group photo near the end of the party.
  - Serves as a memory of the event and a touchpoint for follow‑up.

    - Turning up the lights.
