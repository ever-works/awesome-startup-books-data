# Zero to One (Paperback) - 2014 Edition

Zero to One is a foundational startup book by Peter Thiel that explores how to build innovative companies that create fundamentally new value (“going from 0 to 1”) rather than simply copying existing models. It offers contrarian principles on monopoly, competition, technology, and startup strategy, making it a must-read for founders and anyone interested in creating high-impact startups.
