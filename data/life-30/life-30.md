## Overview
“Life 3.0” is a popular science book by physicist Max Tegmark that explores the future of artificial intelligence and its potential impact on humanity, society, and the future of work. While not a startup playbook, it provides strategic context for founders and builders working with AI, helping them think about long‑term implications, ethics, and the kinds of futures their products may enable.

## Features

- **Exploration of AI’s future**  
  Examines how advanced AI could reshape human life, work structures, and global systems.

- **Distinction between intelligence and consciousness**  
  Clarifies that creating increasingly intelligent systems does not automatically mean they are conscious, raising questions about what we are truly building.

- **Focus on intentional AI development**  
  Encourages readers—especially technologists and founders—to build AI systems with deliberate goals and values rather than defaulting to purely capability-driven progress.

- **Scenarios for AI-driven futures**  
  Discusses different possible trajectories for AI (social, economic, and political) and what each could mean for humanity.

- **Challenge to ‘inevitable future’ narratives**  
  Argues that there is no single predetermined outcome where “AI will take over”; human decisions, policies, and design choices play a central role.

- **Emphasis on founder responsibility**  
  Highlights that founders and builders participate directly in shaping AI’s trajectory, rather than being passive observers.

- **Long-term thinking as core to leadership**  
  Frames long-term vision, alignment, and responsibility as essential leadership qualities, not optional extras, particularly in AI and deep tech.

- **Strategic context for AI startups**  
  Helps AI and tech founders assess risks, opportunities, and ethical considerations that can inform product roadmaps and company missions.

- **Reflection on AI and humanity**  
  Encourages readers to consider what kind of future they want to help create, both as professionals and as humans.
