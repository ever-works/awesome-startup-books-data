description: A classic personal development book by Maxwell Maltz that explores
  self-image psychology and its impact on performance, confidence, and goal
  achievement. While not startup-specific, it is widely recommended for founders
  and entrepreneurs as a must-read for building a resilient mindset, overcoming
  self-doubt, and improving focus and productivity—key traits for navigating the
  challenges of starting and scaling a company.
