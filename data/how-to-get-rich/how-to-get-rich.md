## Overview
“How to Get Rich” by Felix Dennis is a candid, first‑person account of building wealth. Drawing on Dennis’s own experience as a multimillionaire entrepreneur, the book focuses on the attitudes, decisions, and trade‑offs involved in creating a highly successful business, rather than on technical investment tactics.
