### Overview
“The Other Side of Innovation” examines how to execute innovation inside established organizations.

It is especially relevant for founders and leaders transitioning from early experimentation to building repeatable, scalable execution.

- **Process design for new initiatives** – Discusses how to design processes tailored for uncertain, innovative work rather than routine operations.
- **Metrics and measurement** – Addresses how to create and use metrics that fit early-stage initiatives instead of applying standard performance KPIs too early.
