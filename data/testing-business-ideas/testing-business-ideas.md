## Overview

“Testing Business Ideas” by David J. Bland and Alexander Osterwalder is a practical field guide to systematically validating business models, products, and features through rapid experimentation. It helps founders, innovators, and teams reduce the risk of building products nobody wants by breaking ideas into testable assumptions and running structured experiments.
