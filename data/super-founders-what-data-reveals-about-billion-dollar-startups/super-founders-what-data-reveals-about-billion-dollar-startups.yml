  ### Overview
  “Super Founders” is a data-driven analysis of hundreds of billion-dollar (unicorn) startups. Instead of relying on anecdotal success stories, Ali Tamaseb uses quantitative research to identify what statistically distinguishes unicorn founders and companies from typical startups. The book is intended for early-stage and growth-stage founders who want evidence-based guidance on what actually correlates with outsized outcomes.
